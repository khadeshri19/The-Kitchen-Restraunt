# The-Kitchen-Restraunt
The Kitchen Restaurant Project is an interactive website built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. 
The platform allows users to seamlessly browse menus, order food online, and book tables at the restaurant.
It integrates a responsive front-end for users and a back-end system for handling orders and managing table reservations. 
This project enhances customer convenience by streamlining the entire dining experience, from booking to payment.
